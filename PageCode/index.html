		<h1>UBC</h1>
		<p>Based on the code, UBC appears to be a batch script that provides several options for cleaning and optimizing a Windows PC. Here's a brief summary of what each option does:

    Option 1: Deletes temporary files from various locations on the PC, including the user's temp folder, the Windows temp folder, and the prefetch folder. It also runs the Disk Cleanup tool (cleanmgr.exe) and a PowerShell script (UPC Debloater.ps1) located on the desktop.
    Option 2: Displays some general security tips for keeping a PC safe and secure, and encourages users to contribute to the development of UBC.
    Option 3: Displays a silly PC-related song.
    Option 4: Allows the user to back up a folder of their choice to another location on their PC.
    Option 5: Displays some basic information about the PC's hardware, including RAM, CPU, and storage.
    Option 6: Runs the System File Checker (sfc.exe) to check for and repair any corrupt system files.
    Option 7: Allows the user to install a setup file silently (without any prompts) and provides an optional argument for the setup file.
    Option 8: Displays some additional options, including defragmenting the system drive, running a malware scan, and installing UBC-Moptions from a GitHub repository.
    Option 9: Exits the program.

Note that the script also checks if it's running on Windows 7 or lower and exits if it is, as some of the commands used may not work on those versions of Windows. Additionally, UBC creates a log file (C:\UBCLog.txt) to track its actions and provides ASCII art for a menu display.

It's important to note that running batch scripts can be potentially dangerous, and users should always review the code and understand what it does before running it on their PC.</p>
